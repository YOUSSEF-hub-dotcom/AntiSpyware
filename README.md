# Anti-Spyware Detection and Removal System

## Project Overview
This project is a Software Engineering capstone developed as part of the Software Engineering course. It focuses on designing and implementing an **Anti-Spyware System** that detects and removes spyware threats from user devices, enhancing digital privacy and security.

Collaborators:  
- me : Youssef Mahmoud  
- Ali Mohamed  

The system applies core software engineering principles, including requirements analysis, system design using UML diagrams, and implementation of functional and non-functional requirements.

## Key Features
- **Spyware Detection**: Scans system processes, files, and registry entries for known spyware signatures and behavioral patterns.
- **Threat Removal**: Safely quarantines and removes detected spyware without affecting legitimate software.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Alerts users to suspicious activities.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple dashboard for scanning, reporting, and management.
- **Reporting**: Generates detailed logs of scans and removals.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: [e.g., Python ]
- Frameworks/Libraries: [e.g., tkinter for GUI, psutil for process monitoring, etc.]
- Design Tools: UML (Use Case, Class, Sequence, Activity Diagrams)
- Other: [Any databases, ML if used, etc.]
